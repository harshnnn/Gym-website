        <ol> <h4>How to perform a rope pushdown:</h4>
            <li> Attach a rope attachment to the upper part of a cable machine. Hold the rope with your hands facing each other.</li>

            <li>Keep your shoulders in good alignment during this exercise. The tendency is for the shoulders to tip forwards as you push down.</li>
            <li>Also keep your shoulders stationary during this exercise. Only move your elbows to isolate and focus on the triceps.</li>
            <li>Stand up straight and keep your back in good alignment, and always move in a slow and controlled manner.</li>
